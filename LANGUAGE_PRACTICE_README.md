# Language Practice App

This app has been transformed into a **language practice platform** that allows you to practice conversational skills in any language with AI agents.

## How It Works

1. **Choose a Scenario**: Select from different conversational scenarios like restaurant dining, tourist interactions, job interviews, or shopping.

2. **Select Your Role**: Each scenario has two roles - you play one, the AI agent plays the other.

3. **Practice in Any Language**: Simply speak or type in your target language, and the AI will respond in the same language.

4. **Real-time Conversation**: Have natural, flowing conversations with push-to-talk voice or text input.
